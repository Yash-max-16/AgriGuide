# AgriGuide
AgriGuide is a crop recommender system project with end to end implementation. It takes in certain parameters (soil, atmosphere, rainfall etc) from the user and recommends the best crop to those conditions. The dataset for the project can be found here. Preprocessing and model training is done using python. The algorithms considered are Logistic Regression, SVC, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost out of which Naive Bayes was the best performing model and therefore as been choosen. The frontend is developed using streamlit library of python. The video demo of the web app can be seen by clicking

1. Crop_Recommendation_System_Analysis notebook contains the preproceesing and model training.  
2. Crop_recommendation.csv is the dataset used.  
3. crop_model_nb.pkl is the final model used in the implementation.  
4. app,py contains the frontend code for the web app.
